JSSpeccy: A ZX Spectrum emulator in pure Javascript
===================================================

Foreword to version 2.x
-----------------------
When I started this project in 2009, writing an emulator in Javascript was a
silly idea. Now, thanks to advances in Javascript engines, and new APIs
emerging from HTML5 and WebGL, it has become a significantly less silly idea.

What's new?
-----------
Everything, basically... it's a ground-up rewrite. In particular:

* Z80 core uses typed arrays[0] where appropriate, for a healthy performance
  boost (and significantly less faffing around with '& 0xff' everywhere to get
  around the lack of strong typing in Javascript)
* More Javascript-ish architecture - the Z80 instruction set is built up
  through copious use of closures, rather than borrowing Fuse's Perl generator
  script wholesale. (It's still heavily based on Fuse's Z80 core though.)
* Proper scanline-based display generation. It isn't fully accurate (memory
  contention isn't emulated yet) but things like border stripes display
  correctly.
* 128K support!

Browser support
---------------
I've only tested on Chrome so far. Support for typed arrays and the PixelData
API are absolutely required, and it'll almost certainly stay that way.
